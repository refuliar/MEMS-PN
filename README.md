MEMS-PN is an application designed to extract and analyse phase and frequency noise in MEMS systems. The goals for this applicatino are:

- The application offers a more efficient alternative to traditional transient simulations with Simulink model for extracting the phase noise of the MEMS system.

- The parameters in the model used for this application can be adjusted to accommodate different circuit configurations.
